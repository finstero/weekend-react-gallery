# Photo Gallery

## Description

This is a simple gallery app displaying images chosen by me.

Made using:

Javascript,
Node.js,
React,
Express,
Postico,
PostgresSQL,
and Bootstrap

This app allows the user to "like" a photo, and displays the number of times the photo has been liked. Users may click on the photo to see a description of the photo. Clicking on the description toggles back to the photo.
